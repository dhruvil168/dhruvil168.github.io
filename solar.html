      <h1 class="main_text">Are Solar Panels Right for You?</h1>
      <h2 class="main_text">Not all homes are suitable for solar, it is important to consider these factors before installing:</h2>
      
      <h3 class="main_text">1. Climate</h3>
      <p class="main_text">This will be the biggest factor that you should take in to account. 
        If you are located in a hotter climate with lots of sunshine, 
        then solar energy will be the most suitable green energy option.
        If thats not the case and you live in a more temprate enviroment with more wind than sun, then 
        solar panels will not be optimal. Instead, you might want to check out <a href="wind.html" target="_blank">wind energy</a>
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="main_text">2. Costs</h3>
      <p class="main_text">
        Costs vary greatly house to house becasue of the numerous factors that effect it, such as, roof size, house hieght, what contractor you hire and more. 
        Due to this there is no "average cost" of installing solar panels.
        To find out an estimate you should use a <a href="https://www.solar-estimate.org/" target="_blank">online estimator</a> or talk to a contractor in person. 
        When recieving a cost estimate, it is important to ackknoledge that many states offer monetary incentives and/or pay you for any extra energy that your panels produce.
