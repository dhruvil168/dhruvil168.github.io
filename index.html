      Our Story:
    </h2>
    <p class="main_text">
      We first opened our doors in 2019, and as you may know, what events came soon after, we only had our doors open for six months before we were forced to close them, we did not know how long this would last.
      Our team went hard at work to comply with regulations so that we may reopen. 
      However, the pandemic lasted for much longer than any of us anticipated. 
      To ensure no one was laid off, our owners found work elsewhere and poured every penny into the restaurant. 
      Soon after, we learned that we would be able to open once again. 
      We relaunched and have been busy every day since. 
      We have a passion for the world, our environment, and our community. 
      We decided that it was time for change in our community, and we plan to be part of that change.

      Charity Work:
    </h2>
    <p class="main_text">
      During the tough times of COVID-19, we noticed the challenges many folks in our community were facing. 
      It made us more aware of the struggles of less fortunate, and it inspired us to step up and make a difference by offering good food for free to anyone in need.
    </p>
    <p class="main_text">
      Every day, we reach out to people in our community with the goal of helping at least one person. 
      We want everyone to feel welcome and know that they have a place with us. 
      Our restaurant is all about supporting our neighbors, and providing meals to those without access to food is truly at the heart of what we do!

      Enviromental Impact:
    </h2>
    <p class="main_text">
      Mother Earth is facing significant challenges, which is why we have made a conscious decision to rely exclusively on solar energy. 
      By doing so, we reduce our carbon footprint and minimize the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. 
      However, our commitment to sustainability extends beyond energy; we have taken various steps to promote environmental responsibility in every aspect of our restaurant.
    </p>
    <p class="main_text">
      When it came time to furnish our space, we sought out reclaimed materials, ensuring that each piece not only tells a story but also contributes to a more sustainable future. 
      From our tables and chairs to our tablecloths made from recycled plastics, we have intentionally made choices that support both the planet and the community.
    </p>
    <p class="main_text">
      At the heart of our mission is the desire to offer not only great food but also a welcoming space that reflects our dedication to making a positive impact. 
      Every detail, whether big or small, is part of our commitment to serving good food in a conscious environment.
